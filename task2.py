Test 2
-----
Scan all files in any folder
e.g. usr/share/doc recursively and group them by first three letters.
For each 3-letter group sort the filenames in that group by the
actual size of the files in reverse order. Store the resulting structure in
a dictionary called result

Example:
{
'aam': [(42281, 'aamfigs.pdf'), (1219, 'aamfigs.tex')],
'aas': [(113610, 'aassymbols.pdf'), (4753, 'aassymbols.tex.gz')],
...
'zxj': [(132386, 'zxjafont.pdf'), (3182, 'zxjafont.tex.gz'
'zz_': [(654,'zz_translate_test.crm')]
}
